	<h5>Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre and Dana Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center Announce Plans to Partner on the Development of a Radiotherapy Program</h5>
<p>Hamilton, Bermuda – September 17, 2015 -- Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre and <a href="http://www.brighamandwomens.org/bwhcancer/default.aspx" target="blank">Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center</a> (DF/BWCC) announce today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on the development of a radiotherapy program.</p>
<p>“This is the next very important phase in developing radiation therapy plans for the local treatment of cancer patients in Bermuda. Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre recognizes how crucial it is to establish collaborative clinical affiliations with overseas cancer centers so that we will safely and effectively provide the highest quality level of cancer care locally,” says Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre, Executive Director, Tara Soares.</p>
<p>Experts from DF/BWCC will advise Bermuda on issues related to the development of the program, including design of a facility, the creation of clinical radiation oncology policies, procedures and safety protocols and the development of a training and education program. Additionally, BWH will work with Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre to explore the opportunity to participate in research opportunities as well as a telemedicine program.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre to expand the radiation oncology services available to patients in Bermuda. We share a commitment to providing patient and family-centered care, and through this partnership, most patients who require radiation therapy will no longer need to travel off the island to receive high quality care,” said <a href="http://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/Details/12752?LastName=Haas-Kogan&amp;Index=1" target="blank">Daphne Haas-Kogan, MD</a>, chair, Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center and professor at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>Partners HealthCare International® (PHI), the international arm of Partners HealthCare, and its member hospitals have worked in collaboration with the Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre, the Bermuda Hospitals Board, as well as Bermuda’s insurance and physician providers to elevate local health care services for nearly 15-years. “The impact of an expanded cancer care program will not only address escalating health care costs for the country, it will also make care more efficient and less stressful for Bermudians. The partnership between DF/BWCC and the Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre marks another important milestone in the work we do on the island,” said Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge, CEO for PHI.</p>
<p>Chairman of Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre’s Board of Directors, Glen Gibbons states, “Dana Farber / Brigham and Women’s Cancer Centre is ranked the 4th Best Hospital for Adult Cancer treatment in the USA, according to the US News Best Hospitals Rankings for 2015. We are proud to partner with them to provide our patients in Bermuda access to the latest therapies at a comprehensive radiation treatment facility with a mission of providing cancer treatment to everyone who needs it, regardless of their ability to pay.”</p>

	<p>Boston, MA - May 14, 2015 -- In recognition of International Nurses Day, Partners HealthCare International® (PHI) this week announced a year-long global initiative that will focus on nurses as a force for change in improving health care quality, efficiency, education, and work environment. "Nurses represent the largest percent of our global healthcare workforce and their ability to lead, influence and impact improvements cannot be underestimated," said Elizabeth Brown, Director of Nursing and Global Programs for PHI. This year's theme for International Nurses Day is "Nurses Force for Change: Care Effective, Cost Effective," and PHI is kicking off activities by launching a digital library (<a href="http://www.partners.org/international/News-And-Perspectives/Events/International-Nurses-Day.aspx" target="blank">www.partners.org/international/forceforchange2015</a>) that highlights global partnerships, projects and initiatives driven by the nurses from Partners HealthCare member hospitals, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the network's affiliated community hospitals and departments.</p>
<p>According to the International Council of Nurses (ICN), sponsors of International Nurses Day, "nurses are part of the solution to achieve better health for all in a care effective, cost effective way." The World Health Organization (WHO) reports the average number of nurses per population across the world is estimated to be 29 for every 10,000 people, yet this rate differs drastically across countries and regions, challenging the safe, effective delivery of patient care. Lower nurse staffing, increased workloads, and unstable nursing unit environments are linked to negative patient outcomes ranging from falls to medication errors, [For more on worldwide nursing trends, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU7RHciqa-I" target="blank">Global Nursing by the Numbers</a>]. As a result, nurses from the bedside to the boardroom are working to make a positive impact to improve how nurses are educated and how care is delivered.</p>
<p>As part of the year-long initiative, Partners is demonstrating how nurses across the world are embracing this year's theme. "Nurses globally are working to strengthen competencies as health care delivery becomes more complex, are being recognized as a valued member of the care team, and are dedicated to improving working conditions and the quality of care and patient safety," said Brown.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years PHI has had the opportunity to partner with global health care organizations for bilateral sharing of best practices to improve the critical skills of their nurses with the goal of providing safe, high-quality patient care. In its work with clients, PHI engages the vast expertise and knowledge available throughout the Partners nursing community. "We invite the global nursing community to visit the digital library throughout the year and see how nurses are working to help innovate and shape the future of nursing," said Brown.</p>
